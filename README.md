# Demo_DSDN_2024

Developed a mini game inspired by the cartoon series Adventure Time.
In this game, BMO will explore the mini world, trying to get into the house. 
In the journey, BMO will need to break crates, and go on jumping scales. 

The sprites and environmental pawns are made in 3D using Blender. 
Player mechanics such as interactions and movements are made using Unreal Engine's blueprint visual scripting system. 
Used Unreal Engine 5 to build the game and Blender to make the game. 

# Game movements
To walk right and left, use the arrow keys.
To jump, use the space bar. 
BMO is able to double jump. 
To break the wooden crates, you can double jump and press the down arrow key. 
You can jump higher on the scales if you press the space bar at the same time as when BMO lands on the scale.
